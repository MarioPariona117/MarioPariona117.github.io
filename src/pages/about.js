        Hi there! I’m Mario Pariona, a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Cambridge with a passion for harnessing the power of Machine Learning to make a positive impact in the world. 
        My journey in computer science began in 2020 after high school when I discovered my love for programming through competitive programming. 
        This passion has evolved into a keen interest in Neural Networks, Convolutional Networks (CNNs), and reinforcement learning (RL), as I seek to leverage these technologies to solve real-world problems.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        My academic journey has been profoundly shaped by a deep appreciation for mathematics, which blossomed during high school when I represented my country in numerous international Olympiads.
        The rigorous environment pushed me to excel, fostering a competitive spirit and a passion for problem-solving that continues to drive my pursuits in Computer Science and Machine Learning.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        Beyond academics, I cherish the joy of movement and the friendship of sports.
        Whether it’s playing football, engaging in ultimate frisbee, or going for a run, I discover balance and joy through physical activity.
        These experiences highlight the value of physical activity, friendship, and mental well-being in people’s lives, which align with my core values. 
        I strive to embody principles of love, humility, and compassion in everything I do, drawing strength and motivation from my Catholic faith.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        As I continue to explore the intersections of technology and humanity, I’m committed to creating innovative solutions that enhance lives and empower communities.
        I invite you to join me on this journey, as I learn, grow, and strive to make a difference in the world.
