          Hi there! I'm Mario Pariona.

      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Cambridge with a growing passion for Machine Learning (ML). 
        While Iâ€™m still in the early stages of my ML journey, Iâ€™ve been diving into the theory behind neural networks, 
        convolutional networks, and reinforcement learning. Every step I take in this field excites me, and Iâ€™m eager to 
        continue exploring how these technologies can solve real-world problems.

        Outside of my studies, Iâ€™m always on the move! I recently started running, and itâ€™s quickly become one of my 
        favorite ways to stay active and clear my mind. Iâ€™m also a big fan of football and ultimate frisbee, which keep 
        me grounded in teamwork and friendly competition.

      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        Whether itâ€™s in my studies or in my hobbies, Iâ€™m all about pushing myself to grow and improve every day.
