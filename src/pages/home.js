          I'm Mario Pariona, a Computer Science student at the University of Cambridge. My journey into the world of Computer Science began with a passion for Mathematical Olympiads.

          <p>
            After high school, I discovered the fascinating world of competitive programming, where I explored how machines can be exploited to do things humans arenâ€™t even close to do.

            {/* I'm Mario Pariona, and I'm passionate about learning, solving complex problems. 
            As a past Mathe Olympiad participant and current Competitive Programmer, I've gained so much experience in problem-solving, that I now use to make the world a better place?
            I'm currently studying Computer Science at Trinity College, the Universtiy of Cambridge. 
            I have done Math Olympiads and a little of Informatics Olympiads in high school.
            I am kind of new to the CS world since I got into it kind of late (17 years without touching a computer) compared to my others peers who were born coding. So far, I am mostly interested in Machine Learning. 
            I love to play football and recently, I become really excited about Ultimate Frisbe. 
            My journey revolves around technology, sports, and innovation.
